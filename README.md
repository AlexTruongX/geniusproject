# GUI Calculator

This is a clean-GUI calculator designed with UI/UX in mind and developed using JavaScript. 

If I were to improve upon this project, I would add a feature that could record keystrokes which could directly input into the calculator and redesign the display screen to at least visually display common mathematical equations or functions that most people are accustomed to, concealing the visuals of the back-end code.
