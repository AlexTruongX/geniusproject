This is a clean-GUI calculator designed with UI/UX in mind and developed using JavaScript.

If I were to improve upon this project, I would add a feature that could record keystrokes that would directly input into the calculator and redesign the display screen to visually display common mathematical equations or functions that most people are accustomed to instead of the wonky back-end code.
